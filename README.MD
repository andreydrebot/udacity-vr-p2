It took around 15-20 hours to complete this project.

I liked a fun with the globe and its animations.

I didn't like the fact that the starter project is not deployable to Android without manual tweaks to installed sdk. 

The most challenging thing was to deploy successfully to the device. Could not do that until I commented out a part of TriggerAnimation script.
